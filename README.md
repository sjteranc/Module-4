### Description

In a world where time and distance do not matter, a squad of drones has been tasked with delivering packages for a major online reseller. Each drone can carry a specific weight and can make multiple deliveries before returning to home base to pick up additional loads; however, the goal is to make the fewest number of trips as each time the drone returns to home base it is extremely costly to refuel and reload the drone.

The purpose of the written software will be to accept input which will include the name of each drone and the maximum weight it can carry, along with a series of locations and the total weight needed to be delivered to that specific location. The software should highlight the most efficient deliveries for each drone to make on each trip.

Assume that time and distance to each drop off location do not matter, and that size of each package is also irrelevant. It is also assumed that the cost to refuel and restock each drone is a constant and does not vary between drones. The maximum number of drones in a squad is 100, and there is no maximum number of deliveries which are required.

### Key Points Summary:

- Accept input including the name of each drone and its maximum carrying capacity.
- Receive a series of locations and the total weight needed to be delivered to each location.
- Determine the most efficient deliveries for each drone on each trip.
- Minimize the number of trips for each drone to optimize resource usage.
- Consider the constant cost of refueling and restocking each drone.
- Handle a squad of up to 100 drones.
- Do not set a maximum limit on the number of required deliveries.
